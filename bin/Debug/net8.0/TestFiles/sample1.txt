Huffman coding is a greedy algorithm used for lossless data compression. It was developed by David A. Huffman in 1952 while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT.

The main idea is that characters appearing more frequently are encoded with shorter bit sequences, while rare characters get longer codes. This allows significant size reduction compared to fixed-length encoding.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Calculate the frequency of each character in the text
2. Build a Huffman tree where leaves are characters with their frequencies
3. Generate prefix codes for each character based on the tree path
4. Encode the text using the generated codes

Advantages of Huffman coding:
- Optimal compression for given character frequencies
- Simple to implement
- Fast operation with O(n log n) complexity
- Lossless decompression is possible

The algorithm is widely used in many compression formats such as DEFLATE (ZIP, GZIP), JPEG, MP3, and others. It forms the foundation of modern data compression techniques.
